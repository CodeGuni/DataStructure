# LEETCODE SOLUTIONS BY GUNI

Welcome to my repository of LeetCode problem solutions! This repo contains my solutions to various problems on LeetCode, organized by difficulty and topic. It's a collection of coding challenges that I solve as part of my journey to improve my problem-solving skills and master algorithms and data structures.  

# ðŸš€GOALS  
**MASTER ALGORITHMS**: Solve a wide range of problems to build proficiency in algorithms and data structures.  
**SHARPEN PROBLEM-SOLVING SKILLS**: Tackle problems of varying difficulty levels and learn new techniques and strategies.  
**CONTRIBUTE TO THE COMMUNITY**: Share solutions to help others understand the concepts and approaches that I used to solve each problem.  

#ðŸ“‚ REPOSITORY STRUCTURE  
The solutions are organized by difficulty and topic:  

**EASY**: Problems that are relatively straightforward and involve basic algorithms.  
**MEDIUM**: Intermediate-level problems that require a deeper understanding of algorithms and data structures.  
**HARD**: Challenging problems that test advanced problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.  

Each solution is contained in a separate file for clarity and to make it easier for you to explore specific problems.
